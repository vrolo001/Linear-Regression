# Linear-Regression
Exercises form the HarvardX course, started 05/09/19 and ended 23/09/19

This course is the 7th in the Data Science edx certificate, but was taken third due to linear regression being a skill highly used during
my PhD studies, where I wanted to start using R when performing analyses with my own data. Because I skipped some courses, some exercises where particularly challenging because I lacked the knowledge from the courses I skipped (e.g., data wrangling). As such, the difference between my answers and the course's answers is perhaps greater for this course than it is for other courses. However, I think this only highlights my creativity and critical thinking skills in being able to find solutions when I may have a limited knowledge.

Where exercises jump a number, question was theoretical or multiple choice on the platform. Where my answers do not match those the
course wanted, but is nonetheless correct, a note #my answer# is included. Files with the word "assessment" include exercises available
only to verified learners.
